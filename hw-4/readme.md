## Homework Experience on Drawing
This week in coding, I was given the opportunity to create my very first drawing using the techniques explained throughout the focus areas. I was to sketch a self-portrait or monster using java script - focusing on learning the new codes for the shapes and how to fill them appropriately. Like any other week, I made sure to pay close attention to detail throuughout the readings and videos that were available to me, while also reaching to other sources to find the codes that I wanted for color. I knew I wanted to make a monster, so I chose an alien. I took steps that allowed my creation to have one protruding eye off of his head, accompanied by many ellipses and lines that help form the overrall creature. I had one issue in this assignment, and it was that I mispelled 'stroke' with 'stoke,' and it threw me for a loop. Thankfully, my buddy Hans was over to give me a helping hand. I also initially solved the problem by using the 'Web Console' option, which clearly spelled out what I was doing and allowed me to continue my sketch. I am now helping Ben with his sketch and everything is clicking much smoother as I explain procedures to him. Other than that, I found this assignment challenging, yet exciting and am ready to continue working with shapes!
