## Homework Experience With Animation
This week in coding, I was instructed to create an animation - preferably one that has moving parts given by variables and math. I was also to make sure that I followed a guideline in order to have all of the parts moving in the way that I wanted them to. This week was the first week where I was really scratching my head, wondering "What the?" I re-read information and re-read it again, while making sure to pay extra careful attention that way I could have a better grasp on the task-at-hand. The videos were great this week and really helped me understand the looping of the draw function. I also used a different website for color that allowed me to move a cursor for different shades, while providing the code. The steps I took were to look at the professor's example over and over until I understood where to input functions, especially popping. I had some difficulties with not having a pop to end the push, which was making my character stick to the top left corner of the canvas. Fortunately, I was able to figure it all out on my own and didn't use the class repo (although I did think about it once or twice). I wanted to see if I could make my way through the exercise, and I was successful! However, I did help Ben by providing an extra set of eyes to see where his error was that made his character do the same thing. I plan to check the repo out to see if I can offer any help!
