# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

In this code, lines 1-10 are setting the variables for the ball. This includes defining the radius, declaring the start and stop position of the ball, determining its change of position on the x and y axis and its trail. Next, lines 12-15 create and setup the canvas and its color. In lines 21 and 22, the code is multiplying by itself to advance. The "if" statements in lines 25-30 make it so that the ball will have the bouncing effect within its written constraints, for both the x and y axis. Lines 32-34 draw and color the eclipse. Lastly, lines 36-39 are determining the mousePressed function, altering the path of the eclipse by clicking the mouse. A mouse click will change its speed and direction. I also noticed that the code is mapped, which can change the size of the ball.

## How did you alter the sketch?
I altered the sketch by changing the size and positioning of the ball. I decided to make it primarily change my picture by the mouseIsPressed function, which starts the code over and changes where the ball is at on the canvas. I also made it to where I have ellipses of random sizes popping up as the mouseIsPressed. I decided to make the color of the background and the ellipses to be random because I think it is more interesting this way. I didn't want the screen to be completely blacked out by the ball, so I made it smaller in size that way people can see the floating ellipses in the back. At first, I only had three ellipses coming at random while pressing the mouse, but this was too dull for me. By adding two more ellipses, one can almost see an afterburn of the previous ellipses, creating layers that give the picture more depth. Clicking anywhere on the screen will trigger the flashing ellipses, and the ball will continue its flow until the mouse is held again.
