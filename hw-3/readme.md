## p5 Hello World!
["Hello World!" Sketch](https://trason-provence.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

## Homework Experience
This homework cycle led to learning the p5 function and how it can create sketch's and texts. We also touched on the draw function and creating ellipses, which I thought was super cool. The steps I took to complete this assignment were following all of the directions 100 percent. I also chose to watch the videos as I think they are super useful and give great insight and great help to look back on. The biggest issue I had during this assignment was that I was having troubles pushing my changes to my 120-work repository. I went into Dr. Musick's office for help and was informed that GitHub is making interface changes that are resulting in errors. All we had to do is pull up the Command Prompt and enter a specific code and it let me push changes right through. I did use the issue tracker and my classmate, Jon Swallow, along with Michael Musick helped tremendously. I honestly have no questions about what we learned, but maybe more on what else GitHub is changing that is giving people troubles. I looked at the issues to see if I could give any assistace, but everyone seemed to have been helped and I was the one seeking it.
