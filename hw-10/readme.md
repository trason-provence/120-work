## Homework Experience
For this week in coding, we started to work with arrays and learned a little more about how they work. Like always, I read through the lesson and watched all of the videos so that I could grasp a better understanding of what I'm working with. Once reaching the homework tab, I decided to go off of the example because I just realized this was late. I thought it was due on Thursday, so I tried to rush it more than usual, while still putting my own spin on it. I changed the background and smiley face color and also the frequency of smileys popping up and out. I wanted to make it a little more abstract, so I made the background and smiley color the same to give it depth and really make one concentrate their eyes. I worked and talked with two people in the class to figure out issues, but I definitely made sure to check the git issues as they popped up in my email.
